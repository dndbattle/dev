Welcome to DnDbattle.com, your go-to tool for simulating Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition combat encounters.
Whether you're a seasoned Dungeon Master or just starting out, our simulator is designed to help you balance encounters, test strategies, and ensure your players have a challenging yet fair experience.

Party Creation: Build your adventuring party by selecting from premade characters, customizing classes and levels, or importing characters directly from D&D Beyond.
Encounter Balancing: Simulate battles between your party and monsters to see how they fare. Adjust party size, levels, and monster composition to fine-tune the difficulty.
Combat Simulation: Watch the battle unfold turn by turn, with dice rolls, spell ranges, and area-of-effect mechanics all calculated automatically.
Multi-Fight Scenarios: Simulate multiple encounters in a row to see how your party handles a full adventuring day.
Why Use DnDbattle.com?
Our simulator is designed to take the guesswork out of encounter design. By running multiple simulations, you can:

Prevent TPKs: Avoid accidentally overwhelming your players with encounters that are too difficult.
Optimize Strategies: Test different party compositions and tactics to find the most effective approach.
Save Time: Quickly generate balanced encounters without spending hours crunching numbers.

How It Works
Create Your Party: Choose from premade characters or customize your own. You can also import characters from D&D Beyond.
Add Monsters: Search for monsters and add them to the encounter. Adjust their numbers and levels to match your party's strength.
Simulate the Battle: Run the simulation to see how the encounter plays out. Review detailed statistics and turn-by-turn results.
Refine and Repeat: Adjust your party or monsters and run the simulation again until you're satisfied with the balance.
